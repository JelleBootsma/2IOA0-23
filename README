Hello!

We are group 23, and this is our prototype for a data visualization website.
This website can be ran by going to the folder directory in your command prompt, inside of the project's directory,
(sampledata_vis) you can open the virtual environment by entering:
Scripts\activate.
Then you can run the project by:
python manage.py runserver

You can also find our website through this link:
https://group23datavisualization.herokuapp.com/

We have two basic visualizations implemented on the website:
1. Coauthorship visualization
2. Weighted Network graph
These visualizations can be found through selecting the links to these visualizations on either the navigation bar called
visualizations, or at the bottom of our homepage. Visualization 3 and loading data are not yet available. The
visualizations might take some time, we are still working on runtime improvements.
