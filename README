Hello!

We are group 23, and this is our prototype for a data visualization website.
This website can be ran by going to the folder directory in your command prompt, inside of the project's directory,
(sampledata_vis) you can open the virtual environment by entering:
Scripts\activate.
Then you can run the project by:
python manage.py runserver


We have three visualizations implemented on the website:
1. Force directed diagram
2. Radial node link diagram
3. Adjacency matrix
These visualizations can be found through selecting the links to these visualizations on either the navigation bar called
visualizations, or by clicking on start, choosing a dataset and clicking on the desired diagram in step 3. It is also possible
to upload your own files. Note that the Radial node link diagram works best with the Author similarity dataset. The
visualizations might take some time, we are still working on runtime improvements.

The Force directed diagram works well, takes some time to laod and has zooming in options integrated in the bar on the side.
The Radial node link diagram, there you can choose using the table above the graph which node you want to focus one and then you can click
on the other nodes in the graph to see that path/paths between the target node and the selected node.
The Adjacency matrix has 5 different reorderings. These are Adjacency Matrix, Alphabetical Adjacency, Distance Matrix, Increasing Distance, Decreasing Distance.
